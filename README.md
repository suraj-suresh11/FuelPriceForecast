## Fuel Price Forecasting Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard project visualizes historical fuel price data from data.gov.uk and provides forecasts for petrol and diesel prices for the next 3 years, both with and without Value Added Tax (VAT).

## Features
+ Historical fuel price data visualization
+ Forecasting petrol and diesel prices
+ Comparison of prices with and without VAT
+ Interactive slicers for filtering data
+ Data Source
+ The historical fuel price data is obtained from data.gov.uk and is available in the form of a CSV file.

## Dashboard Overview

### How to Use
1)Data Preparation:
Download the historical fuel price data from data.gov.uk and save it as a CSV file.
Open Power BI Desktop and import the CSV file as the data source.

2)Data Modeling:
Create relationships between the tables (e.g., fuel price data, VAT rates) in the data model.
Define measures and calculated columns for computing VAT-inclusive and VAT-exclusive prices.

3)Dashboard Design:
Design the dashboard layout by adding visualizations such as line charts, slicers, and cards.
Create visualizations to display historical fuel prices and forecasted prices.

4)Forecasting:
Use forecasting features in Power BI to predict petrol and diesel prices for the next 3 years.
Implement forecasting with and without VAT to provide insights into price trends.
Interactivity:

5)Utilize slicers to allow users to filter data based on parameters like date range, fuel type, etc.
